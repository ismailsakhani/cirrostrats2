Practice readibility and simplicity. Include description and documentation for others to read and make changes to it

**IS:   
        DONE! make search bar static and minimal
        PARTIALLY DONE! When searching random stuff the `try example` sectino is stuck to the left. Align it to center like home.html

        mobile site layout should be presented when requested a mobile site. - still figurin this out 
        Include Feedback form in the menu section
        link homepage in the menu to the main homepage. Add About section and contact emails. Add sources, create new html for such.
        weather table extends to the edge lines on the sides. restrict them to a few inches away from the edge 
        Investigte this `WARNINGS` from terminal when running `runserver` :
            ?: (staticfiles.W004) The directory 'C:\Users\ujasv\OneDrive\Desktop\codes\Weather_work\dj\static' in the STATICFILES_DIRS setting does not exist.


**UV:   
        DONE! fix and cleanup description in examples on homepage.
        DONE! TAF can be out of index. remove TAF if unavailable. Redirect to no found page if no weather found.
                for example `w kcdw` returns error since index is out range probably because TAF is not available for it.
        Done! Major time issue fixes for pulling lengthy web scrape . 
        DONE! Fix date and time on `i` switch output
        Done! Fix exponentially destructive while loop in the Gate_Scrape_Thread within root_gate_checker.py
        DONE! Add all past queries in the web itself in a menu section so it is easily accessible.
        
        Scrape `scheduled` times less frequently as it is mostly static.
        Only scrape `actual` times more frequently and from different web source to decrease intensive pull.
        move reliable structured data operation into activator().
    	treat unreliable flights at source before it is dumped as master.pkl to keep master pikle clean.
        Account for reliable and unreliable outlaws at source rather than scheduled flights
        
        fix freeze bug on the EC2. After running lengthy scrape for a few days cmd seems to get stuck.
        
        
        seperate end point TAF by "   " and replace it with new line to make it viewable.
        flight deet packet:
            include zulu time top right corner with seconds.
            include zulu departure and arrival times
            examine metar and TAF for parsing and color coding IFR and LIFR ceilings, Visibility, freezing conditions and runway condition codes.
            Highlight weather minimums in red for alternate requirements;(1-2-3 rule per ETA)
                1/2SM as pink and 1/4SM as black
            Highlight Icing conditions in blue; LIFR in pink 
            include gate in this packet of information
            include IFR routing through flight aware if able
            associate flight numbers in gates table to their dedicated information for departure, destination and weather

        make use of http://xml.flightview.com/xmlbdom/ for pulling flight data instead of requests and bs4 libraries
        
        Use models and sql for database management.

        add activator() scrape to include data from few hours later

        Add source information 




Use Flightaware API to extract clearance and route.

When User first accesses the web the date and time of the latest master should be displayed 

Add menu section:
    List all gates, 
    Analyses, statistics and misery map using delay graph.
        e.g: Kudos to gate C101 for most ontime departures. 
            Worst gate for delays(show sorted values)   

need to be able to receive alerts if the weather deteriorates:
    Account for any ground stop or delays there might be at any particular airport in the National Airspace System

add delay information and color code it

setup latest changes page. Include updates with dates and description. 
Fix Gate_Scrape Scrape uppercase. It is unusual.

Deploy the ability to chat. Store all queries with time stamp for later analyses.
    Compare and assess similar frequent queries, account for typo. 
    Take query and if return cannot be formulated let the client know:
        "Unable to process your search at this time.
        It has been added to our resolutions list for further attention with absolute dedication."
        **option** Add Feedback to go with it

add ability to see raw metar or simplified one with only pertinant information.

Big bug when extracting info from other sources. the data can be messy and unreiable. Create redundency

airport name, gate and flight # can be partial/absolute.
    Essentially a functionality to predict in dropdown in search similar to google - indexing.
    search should initiate right away for flight num, airport or gate

Add these query words and functionality to chat :
weather_range = ['met ', ' met', ' met ', 'met', 'taf ', ' taf', ' taf ', 'taf', 'weather', 'metar', 'metar ']

"{gate} for {partial/complete airport ID/name}" = "{gate} {airport}"
"{gate} for {partial/complete airport name}" = "{gate} {airport}"   
"weather for {partial/complete airport} = "{metar} {airport}"
"{flight number} weather" = "{metar} {departure airport} {destination airport}"
"{flight number} destination" = return destination or destination
"{flight number} not, notam, notams" = return notams for departure and destination. include ability to return just pertinant information.
